- **Academic Writing Support**

- **Draft Refinement Engine**  
  Adapt writing styles for different genres, enhance clarity, and track improvements across drafts + no data leaves your device.

### Use Cases  
- Teachers crafting rubric-aligned feedback.  
- Students refining essays offline with discipline-specific suggestions.

- Writers adapting technical content without cloud reliance.
